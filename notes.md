#  notes on multi mls

- implemented the increment internal function for multi mls, check wether it does the right thing
- implemented the multimlsdim class, check wether it does the right thing
- seems like i implemented the add dimension functionality, needs to be checked
- seems like i  implemented the index constructor for multi mls types, needs to be checked
- seems like i rewrote all the pitch  in the manner n00_1 -> -1 n00_2 -> -2 ...  keept the dim number interface, needs to be tested
- seems like i rewrote the whole liouville and output thing, needs to be tested
- compiles and seems to be ok
- not implemented the mls dim truncation for multi mls so far!



- need to write index nlevels support, meaningful output functions for multi mls usage
- then for the whole output thing one sanity check that the mls dim objects refer to the same mls type and generalized n00 functionality

- then there needs to be functionality for different expecation values and so forth

- test what happens when there are no mls at all, just modes
- check the index constructor "Before truncation: setup stage" step, it is wrong but it works anyway so it seems to be obsolete
- search for all TODO marked code lines and do the thing...
- what happens with the superradiant stuff?
